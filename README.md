# TimeCounter
 Stupidity is not a right.  
 Basically, it is a time counter with specific configurations. One part is "how long has it been since ...", the other part is "how long do I need to wait for ...". Totally a meaningless stuff, just for me to memorize someone.  
 Potentially, good for beginners to get familiar with basic tkinter.
